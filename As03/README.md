## Multinomial Naive Bayes 

Multinomial Naive Bayes is one of the most popular supervised learning classifications that is used for the analysis of the categorical text data. Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm is a probabilistic learning method that is mostly used in Natural Language Processing (NLP). The algorithm is based on the Bayes theorem and predicts the tag of a text such as a piece of email or newspaper article. It calculates the probability of each tag for a given sample and then gives the tag with the highest probability as output.
